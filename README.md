# Encryption Algorithms

Encryption is the process of encoding a message or data in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. There are several encryption algorithms that are commonly used to encrypt data, including:

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a block cipher to encrypt and decrypt data. It was first adopted by the U.S. government in 2001 and has since become one of the most widely used encryption algorithms in the world.

AES uses a key to encrypt and decrypt data. The key can be either 128, 192, or 256 bits long. The longer the key, the more secure the encryption.

## DES (Data Encryption Standard)

DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was developed by IBM in the 1970s. It uses a block cipher to encrypt and decrypt data.

DES uses a key to encrypt and decrypt data. The key is 56 bits long, which makes it less secure than modern encryption algorithms like AES.

## RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt data. It was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977.

RSA is widely used for secure data transmission and digital signatures. It is considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms available today.

RSA uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, while the private key is used to decrypt data. The keys are mathematically related, but it is virtually impossible to derive the private key from the public key.
